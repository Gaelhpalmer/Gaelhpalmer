👋 Hi, I’m @Gaelhpalmer :)

<strong>About me:</strong>
- 🌱 I’m pursuing a major in Neuroscience and a minor in Data Science.
- 🎻 I'm a violinist/violist who is passionate about music, music in care, and social prescription (particularly of community-based arts programs).
- 🖥️ I'm extremely interested in AI and Machine Learning (especially in healthcare settings)! Some of my interests include computer vision tasks (such as semantic segmentation, classification, and feature extraction), Automated Speech Recognition (STT, diarization, sentiment analysis) as well as LLMs and generative models.
